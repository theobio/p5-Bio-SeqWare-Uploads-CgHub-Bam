complex stepwise process involving tracking progress and errors using a
database.

=head1 INTERNALS

Nothing in this section is necessary for using this program, this is aimed only
at developers (mostly me). The implementation details described here may
change without advanced warning and possibly without updating documentation, as
this is not part of the API. You have been warned :)

This application mostly just runs code in the main application module,
Bio::SeqWare::Uploads::CgHub::Bam.

=head1 SEE ALSO

This is part of the p5-Bio-SeqWare-Uploads-CgHub-Bam distribution. The main
documentation is the Bio::SeqWare::Uploads::CgHub::Bam module POD.

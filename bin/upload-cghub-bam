  options:
    --version  Print the version
    --help     Extended option descriptions

    --verbose  Extra output
    --debug    Lots of extra output

=item --config [FILE]

The config file, provides defaults for options. See the CONFIG FILE section
for more details. This can be an absolute or relative path. If no config file
is specified, the default config file looked for will be "~/.seqware/settings".

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is used to upload bam files to CgHub, which is a relatively
complex stepwise process involving tracking progress and errors using a
database.

=cut

=head1 CONFIG FILE

=head2 Example

   # An example config file (no leading space should be used on left)
   # This is a comment, which will be ignored, as will the next two lines
   #
   
   dbUser = seqware
   dbPassword = "seqware"
   dbHost = dbtest.bioinf.unc.edu
   db = seqware_meta_db
   
   debug = 1
   
=head2 Description

A config file is used as the defaults for options. Any options, except
the --config parameter, can be read from the conifig file. Options specified
on the command line will over-ride anything from the config file. If no
config file is specified, a default config file "~/.seqware/settings will be
looked for. This file should be readable only by the user; chmod 600 this
file if not.

Note, unlike the command line, options specified in the config
file need not be used, allowing one config file to contain parameters for
multiple programs. The drawback is if an option is misspelled in the
config file, it will fail silently. Only the main option name may be used (the
first given above). Aliases and short-option equivalents can only be used on
the command line.

The contents of the file are interpreted as follows:

=over 3

=item Blank lines

Lines consisting of only all white space are ignored

=item Comment lines

Lines where the first character in the line is a "#" symbol are comment lines
and are ignored.

=item option = value lines

The main content of the config file will be lines with an option name (without
the leading "--" ). If the option can take a value, it is separated from the
option by an "=" sign. If the option or value have leading or trailing spaces,
these are removed. If the first and last character of the value are quotes or
appostrophies, they will be removed and the value will be converted to a string.
This allows for strings with leading or trailing whitespace, escaped characters,
etc.

=head1 INTERNALS

Nothing in this section is necessary for using this program, this is aimed only
at developers (mostly me). The implementation details described here may
change without advanced warning and possibly without updating documentation, as
this is not part of the API. You have been warned :)

This application mostly just runs code in the main application module,
Bio::SeqWare::Uploads::CgHub::Bam.

=head1 SEE ALSO

This is part of the p5-Bio-SeqWare-Uploads-CgHub-Bam distribution. The main
documentation is the Bio::SeqWare::Uploads::CgHub::Bam module POD.
